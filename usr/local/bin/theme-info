will be some items that will not adapt
to the change; such as, some items in 
the system tray, the color of 
notifications, and open applications. 

A simple Log Out and Log In will fix 
this.

PLEASE NOTE: If you change anything
within a pre-installed theme through
Customize Look and Feel; such as, the
icons, mouse cursor, font, etc., you 
may want to consider copying the 
'settings.ini' found in...

~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

...into the appropriately named
folder (of the theme you are using) 
found in...

~/.config/jwm/

...so that it will be available if
you change themes in the future."
